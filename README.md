## About this project

This project was another practice for me turning a design file into HTML & CSS.

The design file was provided by [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/news-homepage-H6SWTa1MFl)

I first coded the mobile version of the website and then moved onto the desktop version.

I found this to be quite a challenging project as the layout is more complicated than things I have made in the past.
